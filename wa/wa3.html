    <p> A <b>documentary film</b> or <b>documentary</b> is a non-fictional motion-picture intended to "document reality, primarily for the purposes of 
        instruction, education or maintaining a historical record".[1] Bill Nichols has characterized the documentary in terms of "a 
        filmmaking practice, a cinematic tradition, and mode of audience reception [that remains] a practice without clear boundaries".[2]</p>
    <p> Early documentary films, originally called "actuality films", lasted one minute or less. Over time, documentaries have evolved to
        become longer in length, and to include more categories. Some examples are educational, observational and docufiction. 
        Documentaries are very informative, and are often used within schools as a resource to teach various principles. Documentary 
        filmmakers have a responsibility to be truthful to their vision of the world without intentionally misrepresenting a topic. 
        Social-media platforms (such as YouTube) have provided an avenue for the growth of the documentary-film genre. 
        These platforms have increased the distribution area and ease-of-accessibility.</p>

        <p>Polish writer and filmmaker Bolesław Matuszewski was among those who identified the mode of documentary film. He wrote two of the earliest texts on cinema Une 
            nouvelle source de l'histoire (eng. A New Source of History) and La photographie animée (eng. Animated photography). Both were published in 1898 in French and 
            among the early written works to consider the historical and documentary value of the film.[3] Matuszewski is also among the first filmmakers to propose the 
            creation of a Film Archive to collect and keep safe visual materials.</p>

        <p>The word "documentary" was coined by Scottish documentary filmmaker John Grierson in his review of Robert Flaherty's film Moana (1926), published in the New York 
        Sun on 8 February 1926, written by "The Moviegoer" (a pen name for Grierson).[5]</p>
        
        <p> Grierson's principles of documentary were that cinema's potential for observing life could be exploited in a new art form; that the "original" actor and "original" 
            scene are better guides than their fiction counterparts to interpreting the modern world; and that materials "thus taken from the raw" can be more real than the 
            acted article. In this regard, Grierson's definition of documentary as "creative treatment of actuality"[6] has gained some acceptance, with this position at 
            variance with Soviet film-maker Dziga Vertov's provocation to present "life as it is" (that is, life filmed surreptitiously) and "life caught unawares" 
            (life provoked or surprised by the camera). 
               
        <p> The American film critic Pare Lorentz defines a documentary film as "a factual film which is dramatic."[7] Others further state that a documentary stands out 
            from the other types of non-fiction films for providing an opinion, and a specific message, along with the facts it presents.[8] Scholar Betsy McLane asserted 
            that documentaries are for filmmakers to convey their views about historical events, people, and places which they find significant.[9] Therefore, the advantage 
            of documentaries lies in introducing new perspectives which may not be prevalent in traditional medias such as written publications and school curriculum.[10] </p>
            
        <p>Documentary practice is the complex process of creating documentary projects. It refers to what people do with media devices, content, form, and production strategies 
            to address the creative, ethical, and conceptual problems and choices that arise as they make documentaries.</p>
        
        <p>Documentary filmmaking can be used as a form of journalism, advocacy, or personal expression.</p>

    <p>Early film (pre-1900) was dominated by the novelty of showing an event. They were single-shot moments captured on film: a train entering a station, a boat docking, or factory workers leaving work. These short films were called "actuality" films; the term "documentary" was not coined until 1926. Many of the first films, such as those made by Auguste and Louis Lumière, were a minute or less in length, due to technological limitations (example on YouTube). </p>p
    <p>Films showing many people (for example, leaving a factory) were often made for commercial reasons: the people being filmed were eager to see, for payment, the film showing them. One notable film clocked in at over an hour and a half, The Corbett-Fitzsimmons Fight. Using pioneering film-looping technology, Enoch J. Rector presented the entirety of a famous 1897 prize-fight on cinema screens across the United States.</p>
    <p>In May 1896, Bolesław Matuszewski recorded on film a few surgical operations in Warsaw and Saint Petersburg hospitals. In 1898, French surgeon Eugène-Louis Doyen invited Bolesław Matuszewski and Clément Maurice and proposed them to recorded his surgical operations. They started in Paris a series of surgical films sometime before July 1898.[11] Until 1906, the year of his last film, Doyen recorded more than 60 operations. Doyen said that his first films taught him how to correct professional errors he had been unaware of. For scientific purposes, after 1906, Doyen combined 15 of his films into three compilations, two of which survive, the six-film series Extirpation des tumeurs encapsulées (1906), and the four-film Les Opérations sur la cavité crânienne (1911). These and five other of Doyen's films survive.[12]</p>

    <p>Between July 1898 and 1901, the Romanian professor Gheorghe Marinescu made several science films in his neurology clinic in Bucharest:[13] Walking Troubles of Organic Hemiplegy (1898), The Walking Troubles of Organic Paraplegies (1899), A Case of Hysteric Hemiplegy Healed Through Hypnosis (1899), The Walking Troubles of Progressive Locomotion Ataxy (1900), and Illnesses of the Muscles (1901). All these short films have been preserved. The professor called his works "studies with the help of the cinematograph," and published the results, along with several consecutive frames, in issues of La Semaine Médicale magazine from Paris, between 1899 and 1902.[14] In 1924, Auguste Lumiere recognized the merits of Marinescu's science films: "I've seen your scientific reports about the usage of the cinematograph in studies of nervous illnesses, when I was still receiving La Semaine Médicale, but back then I had other concerns, which left me no spare time to begin biological studies. I must say I forgot those works and I am thankful to you that you reminded them to me. Unfortunately, not many scientists have followed your way."[15][16][17]</p>
