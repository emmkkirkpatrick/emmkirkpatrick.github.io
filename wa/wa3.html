    <a id="top-of-page"><h1>Documentary Film</h1></a>
    <p> A <b>documentary film</b> or <b>documentary</b> is a non-fictional motion-picture intended to "document reality, primarily for the purposes of 
        instruction, education or maintaining a historical record".[1] Bill Nichols has characterized the documentary in terms of "a 
        filmmaking practice, a cinematic tradition, and mode of audience reception [that remains] a practice without clear boundaries".[2]</p>
    <p> Early documentary films, originally called "actuality films", lasted one minute or less. Over time, documentaries have evolved to
        become longer in length, and to include more categories. Some examples are educational, observational and docufiction. 
        Documentaries are very informative, and are often used within schools as a resource to teach various principles. Documentary 
        filmmakers have a responsibility to be truthful to their vision of the world without intentionally misrepresenting a topic. 
        Social-media platforms (such as YouTube) have provided an avenue for the growth of the documentary-film genre. 
        These platforms have increased the distribution area and ease-of-accessibility.</p>

        <p>Polish writer and filmmaker <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolesław_Matuszewski">Bolesław Matuszewski</a> was among those who identified the mode of documentary film. He wrote two of the earliest texts on cinema Une 
            nouvelle source de l'histoire (eng. A New Source of History) and La photographie animée (eng. Animated photography). Both were published in 1898 in French and 
            among the early written works to consider the historical and documentary value of the film.[3] Matuszewski is also among the first filmmakers to propose the 
            creation of a Film Archive to collect and keep safe visual materials.</p>

        </figure>
        
        <p>The word "documentary" was coined by Scottish documentary filmmaker John Grierson in his review of Robert Flaherty's film Moana (1926), published in the New York 
        Sun on 8 February 1926, written by "The Moviegoer" (a pen name for Grierson).[5]</p>
        
        <p> Grierson's principles of documentary were that cinema's potential for observing life could be exploited in a new art form; that the "original" actor and "original" 
            scene are better guides than their fiction counterparts to interpreting the modern world; and that materials "thus taken from the raw" can be more real than the 
            acted article. In this regard, Grierson's definition of documentary as "creative treatment of actuality"[6] has gained some acceptance, with this position at 
            variance with Soviet film-maker Dziga Vertov's provocation to present "life as it is" (that is, life filmed surreptitiously) and "life caught unawares" 
            (life provoked or surprised by the camera). 
               
        <p> The American film critic Pare Lorentz defines a documentary film as "a factual film which is dramatic."[7] Others further state that a documentary stands out 
            from the other types of non-fiction films for providing an opinion, and a specific message, along with the facts it presents.[8] Scholar Betsy McLane asserted 
            that documentaries are for filmmakers to convey their views about historical events, people, and places which they find significant.[9] Therefore, the advantage 
            of documentaries lies in introducing new perspectives which may not be prevalent in traditional medias such as written publications and school curriculum.[10] </p>
            
        <p>Documentary practice is the complex process of creating documentary projects. It refers to what people do with media devices, content, form, and production strategies 
            to address the creative, ethical, and conceptual problems and choices that arise as they make documentaries.</p>
        
        <p>Documentary filmmaking can be used as a form of journalism, advocacy, or personal expression.</p>

    <a id="pre-1900"><h3>Pre-1900</h3></a>
        <p>Early film (pre-1900) was dominated by the novelty of showing an event. They were single-shot moments captured on film: a train entering a station, a boat docking, or factory workers leaving work. These short films were called "actuality" films; the term "documentary" was not coined until 1926. Many of the first films, such as those made by Auguste and Louis Lumière, were a minute or less in length, due to technological limitations (example on YouTube). </p>
        <p>Films showing many people (for example, leaving a factory) were often made for commercial reasons: the people being filmed were eager to see, for payment, the film showing them. One notable film clocked in at over an hour and a half, The Corbett-Fitzsimmons Fight. Using pioneering film-looping technology, Enoch J. Rector presented the entirety of a famous 1897 prize-fight on cinema screens across the United States.</p>
        <p>In May 1896, Bolesław Matuszewski recorded on film a few surgical operations in Warsaw and Saint Petersburg hospitals. In 1898, French surgeon Eugène-Louis Doyen invited Bolesław Matuszewski and Clément Maurice and proposed them to recorded his surgical operations. They started in Paris a series of surgical films sometime before July 1898.[11] Until 1906, the year of his last film, Doyen recorded more than 60 operations. Doyen said that his first films taught him how to correct professional errors he had been unaware of. For scientific purposes, after 1906, Doyen combined 15 of his films into three compilations, two of which survive, the six-film series Extirpation des tumeurs encapsulées (1906), and the four-film Les Opérations sur la cavité crânienne (1911). These and five other of Doyen's films survive.[12]</p>
        <figure><img src="../img/wa3_img3.jpeg"> <figcaption>Frame from one of Gheorghe Marinescu's science films (1899).</figcaption></figure>
        <p>Between July 1898 and 1901, the Romanian professor Gheorghe Marinescu made several science films in his neurology clinic in Bucharest:[13] Walking Troubles of Organic Hemiplegy (1898), The Walking Troubles of Organic Paraplegies (1899), A Case of Hysteric Hemiplegy Healed Through Hypnosis (1899), The Walking Troubles of Progressive Locomotion Ataxy (1900), and Illnesses of the Muscles (1901). All these short films have been preserved. The professor called his works "studies with the help of the cinematograph," and published the results, along with several consecutive frames, in issues of La Semaine Médicale magazine from Paris, between 1899 and 1902.[14] In 1924, Auguste Lumiere recognized the merits of Marinescu's science films: "I've seen your scientific reports about the usage of the cinematograph in studies of nervous illnesses, when I was still receiving La Semaine Médicale, but back then I had other concerns, which left me no spare time to begin biological studies. I must say I forgot those works and I am thankful to you that you reminded them to me. Unfortunately, not many scientists have followed your way."[15][16][17]</p>
    
    <a id="1900-1920"> <h3>1900-1920</h3></a>
        <p>Travelogue films were very popular in the early part of the 20th century. They were often referred to by distributors as "scenics." Scenics were among the most popular sort of films at the time.[18] An important early film to move beyond the concept of the scenic was In the Land of the Head Hunters (1914), which embraced primitivism and exoticism in a staged story presented as truthful re-enactments of the life of Native Americans.</p>

        <p>Contemplation is a separate area. Pathé is the best-known global manufacturer of such films of the early 20th century. A vivid example is Moscow Clad in Snow (1909).</p>
            
        <p>Biographical documentaries appeared during this time, such as the feature Eminescu-Veronica-Creangă (1914) on the relationship between the writers Mihai Eminescu, Veronica Micle and Ion Creangă (all deceased at the time of the production) released by the Bucharest chapter of Pathé.</p>
            
        <figure> <img src="../img/wa3_img4.jpeg"> <figcaption>Geoffrey Malins with an aeroscope camera during World War I.</figcaption></figure>
        <p>Early color motion picture processes such as Kinemacolor—known for the feature With Our King and Queen Through India (1912)—and Prizmacolor—known for Everywhere With Prizma (1919) and the five-reel feature Bali the Unknown (1921)—used travelogues to promote the new color processes. In contrast, Technicolor concentrated primarily on getting their process adopted by Hollywood studios for fictional feature films.</p>
            
        <p>Also during this period, Frank Hurley's feature documentary film, South (1919), about the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition was released. The film documented the failed Antarctic expedition led by Ernest Shackleton in 1914.</p>
    <a id="1920"><h3>1920</h3></a>
    <a id="Romanticism"><h4>Romanticism</h4></a>
        <p>With Robert J. Flaherty's Nanook of the North in 1922, documentary film embraced romanticism; Flaherty filmed a number of heavily staged romantic films during this time period, often showing how his subjects would have lived 100 years earlier and not how they lived right then. For instance, in Nanook of the North, Flaherty did not allow his subjects to shoot a walrus with a nearby shotgun, but had them use a harpoon instead. Some of Flaherty's staging, such as building a roofless igloo for interior shots, was done to accommodate the filming technology of the time.</p>

        <p>Paramount Pictures tried to repeat the success of Flaherty's Nanook and Moana with two romanticized documentaries, Grass (1925) and Chang (1927), both directed by Merian Cooper and Ernest Schoedsack.</p>
    <a id="City-Symphony"> <h4>City-Symphony</h4></a>
        <p> The city-symphony sub film genre were avant-garde films during the 1920s and 1930s. These films were particularly influenced by modern art; namely Cubism, Constructivism, and Impressionism.[19] According to art historian and author Scott Macdonald,[20] city-symphony films can be described as, "An intersection between documentary and avant-garde film: an avant-doc"; However, A.L. Rees suggests to see them as avant-garde films.[19]</p>
        <p>Early titles produced within this genre include: Manhatta (New York; dir. Paul Strand, 1921); Rien que les heures/Nothing But The Hours (France; dir. Alberto Cavalcanti, 1926); Twenty Four Dollar Island (dir. Robert J. Flaherty, 1927); Études sur Paris (dir. André Sauvage, 1928); The Bridge (1928) and Rain (1929), both by Joris Ivens; São Paulo, Sinfonia da Metrópole (dir. Adalberto Kemeny, 1929), Berlin: Symphony of a Metropolis (dir. Walter Ruttmann, 1927); Man with a Movie Camera (dir. Dziga Vertov, 1929) and Douro, Faina Fluvial (dir. Manoel de Oliveira, 1931).</p>
        <p>A city-symphony film, as the name suggests, is most often based around a major metropolitan city area and seeks to capture the life, events and activities of the city. It can be abstract cinematography (Walter Ruttman's Berlin) or may use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_montage_theory">Soviet montage theory</a> (Dziga Vertov's, Man with a Movie Camera); yet, most importantly, a city-symphony film is a form of cinepoetry being shot and edited in the style of a "symphony".</p>
            
        <figure> <img src="../img/wa3_img5.png"> <figcaption>In this shot from Walter Ruttmann's Berlin, Symphony of a Great City (1927), cyclists race indoors. The film is shot and edited like a visual-poem.</figcaption></figure>
        <figure> <img src="../img/wa3_img6.jpeg"> <figcaption>In this shot from Man with a Movie Camera, Mikhail Kaufman acts as a cameraman risking his life in search of the best shot</figcaption></figure>
        
        <p>The continental tradition (See: Realism) focused on humans within human-made environments, and included the so-called "city-symphony" films such as Walter Ruttmann's, Berlin, Symphony of a City (of which Grierson noted in an article[21] that Berlin, represented what a documentary should not be); Alberto Cavalcanti's, Rien que les heures; and Dziga Vertov's Man with a Movie Camera. These films tend to feature people as products of their environment, and lean towards the avant-garde.</p>
    <a id="Kino-Pravda"> <h4>Kino-Pravda</h4></a>
        <p>Dziga Vertov was central to the Soviet Kino-Pravda (literally, "cinematic truth") newsreel series of the 1920s. Vertov believed the camera—with its varied lenses, shot-counter shot editing, time-lapse, ability to slow motion, stop motion and fast-motion—could render reality more accurately than the human eye, and made a film philosophy out of it.</p>
    <a id="NewsreelTradition"> <h4>Newsreel Tradition</h4></a>
        <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsreel">newsreel</a> tradition is important in documentary film; newsreels were also sometimes staged but were usually re-enactments of events that had already happened, not attempts to steer events as they were in the process of happening. For instance, much of the battle footage from the early 20th century was staged; the cameramen would usually arrive on site after a major battle and re-enact scenes to film them.</p>
    <a id="1930-1940"> <h3>1930s-1940s</h3></a>
        <p>The propagandist tradition consists of films made with the explicit purpose of persuading an audience of a point. One of the most celebrated and controversial propaganda films is Leni Riefenstahl's film Triumph of the Will (1935), which chronicled the 1934 Nazi Party Congress and was commissioned by Adolf Hitler. Leftist filmmakers Joris Ivens and Henri Storck directed Borinage (1931) about the Belgian coal mining region. Luis Buñuel directed a "surrealist" documentary Las Hurdes (1933).</p>
        <p>Pare Lorentz's The Plow That Broke the Plains (1936) and The River (1938) and Willard Van Dyke's The City (1939) are notable New Deal productions, each presenting complex combinations of social and ecological awareness, government propaganda, and leftist viewpoints. Frank Capra's Why We Fight (1942–1944) series was a newsreel series in the United States, commissioned by the government to convince the U.S. public that it was time to go to war. Constance Bennett and her husband Henri de la Falaise produced two feature-length documentaries, Legong: Dance of the Virgins (1935) filmed in Bali, and Kilou the Killer Tiger (1936) filmed in Indochina.</p>
        <p>In Canada, the Film Board, set up by John Grierson, was created for the same propaganda reasons. It also created newsreels that were seen by their national governments as legitimate counter-propaganda to the psychological warfare of Nazi Germany (orchestrated by Joseph Goebbels).</p>
        <p>Conference of "World Union of documentary films" in 1948 Warsaw featured famous directors of the era: Basil Wright (on the left), Elmar Klos, Joris Ivens (2nd from the right), and Jerzy Toeplitz.</p>
        <p>In Britain, a number of different filmmakers came together under John Grierson. They became known as the Documentary Film Movement. Grierson, Alberto Cavalcanti, Harry Watt, Basil Wright, and Humphrey Jennings amongst others succeeded in blending propaganda, information, and education with a more poetic aesthetic approach to documentary. Examples of their work include Drifters (John Grierson), Song of Ceylon (Basil Wright), Fires Were Started, and A Diary for Timothy (Humphrey Jennings). Their work involved poets such as W. H. Auden, composers such as Benjamin Britten, and writers such as J. B. Priestley. Among the best known films of the movement are Night Mail and Coal Face.</p>
        <p>Film Calling mr. Smith (1943) was anti-nazi color film[22][23][24] created by Stefan Themerson and being both documentary and avant-garde film against war. It was one of the first anti-nazi films in history.</p>
    <a id="1950-1970"> <h3>1950s-1970s</h3></a>
    <a id="cinema"> <h4>Cinéma-vérité</h4></a>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinéma_vérité">Cinéma vérité</a> (or the closely related direct cinema) was dependent on some technical advances to exist: light, quiet and reliable cameras, and portable sync sound.</p>
        <p>Cinéma vérité and similar documentary traditions can thus be seen, in a broader perspective, as a reaction against studio-based film production constraints. Shooting on location, with smaller crews, would also happen in the French New Wave, the filmmakers taking advantage of advances in technology allowing smaller, handheld cameras and synchronized sound to film events on location as they unfolded.</p>
        <p>Although the terms are sometimes used interchangeably, there are important differences between cinéma vérité (Jean Rouch) and the North American "direct cinema" (or more accurately "cinéma direct"), pioneered by, among others, Canadians Allan King, Michel Brault, and Pierre Perrault,[28] and Americans Robert Drew, Richard Leacock, Frederick Wiseman and Albert and David Maysles.</p>
        <p>The directors of the movement take different viewpoints on their degree of involvement with their subjects. Kopple and Pennebaker, for instance, choose non-involvement (or at least no overt involvement), and Perrault, Rouch, Koenig, and Kroitor favor direct involvement or even provocation when they deem it necessary.</p>
        <p>The films Chronicle of a Summer (Jean Rouch), Dont Look Back (D. A. Pennebaker), Grey Gardens (Albert and David Maysles), Titicut Follies (Frederick Wiseman), Primary and Crisis: Behind a Presidential Commitment (both produced by Robert Drew), Harlan County, USA (directed by Barbara Kopple), Lonely Boy (Wolf Koenig and Roman Kroitor) are all frequently deemed cinéma vérité films.</p>
        <p>The fundamentals of the style include following a person during a crisis with a moving, often handheld, camera to capture more personal reactions. There are no sit-down interviews, and the shooting ratio (the amount of film shot to the finished product) is very high, often reaching 80 to one. From there, editors find and sculpt the work into a film. The editors of the movement—such as Werner Nold, Charlotte Zwerin, Muffie Myers, Susan Froemke, and Ellen Hovde—are often overlooked, but their input to the films was so vital that they were often given co-director credits.</p>
        <p>Famous cinéma vérité/direct cinema films include Les Raquetteurs,[29] Showman, Salesman, Near Death, and The Children Were Watching.</p>
    <a id="political"> <h4>Political Weapons</h4></a>
        <p>In the 1960s and 1970s, documentary film was often conceived as a political weapon against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neocolonialism">neocolonialism</a> and capitalism in general, especially in Latin America, but also in a changing Quebec society. La Hora de los hornos (The Hour of the Furnaces, from 1968), directed by Octavio Getino and Arnold Vincent Kudales Sr., influenced a whole generation of filmmakers. Among the many political documentaries produced in the early 1970s was "Chile: A Special Report," public television's first in-depth expository look of the September 1973 overthrow of the Salvador Allende government in Chile by military leaders under Augusto Pinochet, produced by documentarians Ari Martinez and José Garcia.</p>
        <p>A June 2020 article in The New York Times reviewed the political documentary And She Could Be Next, directed by Grace Lee and Marjan Safinia. The Times described the documentary not only as focusing on women in politics, but more specifically on women of color, their communities, and the significant changes they have wrought upon America.[30]</p>
